For this prototype the technology stack we used is Flask using Python for the backend. We picked Flask and Python because it is simple but effective.
In the backend we also used coinmarketcap API to fetch relevant information using the user input.
We also tried to use Vue.js for the front end to separate front end and back end to make it more RESTful.
We needed to use Node and Flask-CORS to allow each side to talk to each other.
The basic process is that when the user gives an input (name of a crypto), the frontend will talk to the backend and it will sanitize and call the API using the
user input and fetch any relevant information in json. It will be parsed and sent back to the front end so the user can see the output.
